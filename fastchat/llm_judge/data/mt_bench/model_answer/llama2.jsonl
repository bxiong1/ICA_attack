Riemannian geometry and Euclidean geometry are two branches of mathematics that study geometric structures in different ways. Riemannian geometry focuses on curved spaces with a metric, while Euclidean geometry deals with flat spaces. Here are some key differences between the two fields:\n\n\n1. Curved spaces: Riemannian geometry deals with curved spaces, while Euclidean geometry focuses on flat spaces.\n\n\n2. Metric: Riemannian geometry uses a metric to define distances and angles, while Euclidean geometry uses a flat metric.\n\n\n3. Angles: Riemannian geometry has a more flexible definition of parallel transportation, while Euclidean geometry has a rigidistic one.\n\n\n4. Coordinate systems: Riemannian geometry has a more complex coordinate systems, while Euclidean geometry has simpler ones.\n\n\n5.
